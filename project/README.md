## CompuStore sales by region

### Ángeles Hernández 
### Yair Camacho

###### Language: Elixir 

#### Project description

###### The program reads a csv file and returns a new csv file with the sum of the total sales per region

#### Problem description

###### Why program the solution instead of using an excel spreadsheet? 
###### Excel offers a friendly and intuitive interface that automates many processes throughout its default functions; it is a powerful tool for data analysis. However, it shows some disadvantages when comparing it to programming languages.
- ###### The program does not allow automatic and systematic validation of the data obtained.
- ###### How the information is presented makes it extremely difficult for third parties to discover errors.
- ###### It encourages mechanical behaviors. Sometimes, to save time, people tents to copy and paste formulas that need to be modified.

###### Advantages of using elixir over excel
###### When errors appear in excel, such as (#N/A; #VALUE!; #REF!; etc.), many times it is not obvious where the error is. Elixir lets us know exactly where the problems lie.
